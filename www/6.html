    In this chapter, we will learn how to export our project as a Cordova
    project and then configure it for building an apk file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Go to your project settings and fill in the Name, Version, Description and
    ID as shown in Fig 6-1 below.

  </p>
  <p>
      Then export your game and select Cordova as shown in Fig 6-
            2 below.   
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
            Then select a location for the export as shown in Fig 6-3
            below.     
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/6-3.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 6-3. Set location for the export</div>
  </p>
  <p>
            Do not Minify script. Just click the button Next. You will then
            see the Cordova export settings as shown in Fig 6-4 below.
            Make sure your settings is exactly as show. Then click on the
            button ‘Export’.

  </p>
  <p>
            After exporting the project, open the exported folder and you
            should see the files and folders as shown in Fig 6-5 below. In
            this case the exported folder is called Test. Go ahead and
            delete the config.json file.   
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
            Then, edit the config.xml file using any text or code editor as
            shown in Fig 6-6 below.
            Add these two lines:   
  </p>
  <p>
            &lt;preference name=&quot;phonegap-version&quot; value=&quot;cli-8.0.0&quot;/&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
            &lt;plugin name=&quot;cordova-plugin-admob-free&quot;&gt;&lt;variable
            name=&quot;ADMOB_APP_ID&quot; value=&quot;ca-app-pub-
            3940256099942544~3347511713&quot; /&gt;&lt;/plugin&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
            in the correct places as shown in Fig 6-6 as indicated by the
            red labels 1 and 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/6-6.JPG" alt="">    
    <div class="fig">Fig 6-6. Adding phonegap version and app id to config.xml</div>
  </p>
  <p>
            Note that the App ID is given by Google Admob for testing
            purposes. You can refer to this page:   
  </p>
  <p>
            bit.ly/2V1Dbwv
  </p>
  <p>
            You will also need to create 2 icons sized 256 x 256 and 128
            x 128 pixels called icon-256.png and icon-128.png and
            replace those in the www folder.
            For purposes of this chapter, you can use mine :
  </p>
  <p>
            bit.ly/2Vfd9KX   (icon-128.png)
  </p>
  <p>
            bit.ly/2PLZQvR  (icon-256.png)
  </p>
  <p>
            Now you are ready to upload to github.
            We will do that in the next chapter.
