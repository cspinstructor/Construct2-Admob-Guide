    When you created your first layout, Construct 2 also automatically added an
    event sheet with the default name ‘Event Sheet 1’ as shown in Fig 2-1 below.
  </p>
  <p>

    <div class="fig">Fig 2-1. A default event sheet</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      We also need to insert a new object called ‘Touch’. See Fig 2-
      2 below on how to insert it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/2-2.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 2-2. Adding Touch object</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      The Touch object enables mouse-clicks and finger touch to be
      detected. If your game is run on the PC, it will detect mouse-
      clicks. But if it is run on a mobile device, it will detect finger
      touches.Next, go back to Event Sheet 1 and click on the ‘Add Event’
      button as shown in Fig 2-3 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/2-3.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 2-3 Adding an event</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      Then, a new dialog opens up called AddEvent dialog. Go
      ahead and select the Touch object as shown in Fig 2-4 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/2-4.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 2-4 Selecting the Touch object</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      In the next dialog, you will have a choice of a few touch
      events. Take a look at Fig 2-5 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/2-5.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 2-5. Select the ‘On touched object’ event</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      Go ahead and select the ‘On touched object’ event as shown
      in Fig 2-5 above. You will then see the next dialog which is
      called ‘Parameters for touch’ as shown in Fig 2-6 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/2-6.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 2-6. Choosing the touched object</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      From Fig 2-6 above, you will note that you need to first
      choose the object to check for touch. Then in the second
      step, select the ‘btnShowBannerAd’ button. After adding the touch event, your Event sheet 1 should look something like Fig 2-7 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/2-7.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 2-7. Add action</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      The next step is to add an action to be taken once the touch
      event is triggered. We will stop here for this chapter. In the next chapter, we
      will download and install the AdMob plugin.
