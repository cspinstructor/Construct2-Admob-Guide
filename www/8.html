    In this chapter we will be looking at how to create a PhoneGap Build
    account, creating a new app, linking the github repository and building an
    apk file.
  </p>
  <p>
    First we will take a look at at phonegap build account and how it works.
  </p>
  <p>
        PhoneGap build is a free service provided by Adobe to allow
        hybrid mobile app developers to convert their hybrid apps
        created with html, css and javascript into either Android, iOS
        or windows phone packages. However, one limitation of
        phonegap build is that, it only allows you to directly upload 1
        zipped project. If you wanted to upload more projects, you
        will need to do it indirectly via github. That is the reason
        why, in the previous chapter, we studied how to create
        repositories using github. To create a free account with
        phonegap build, just head over to this website:
  </p>
  <p>
        build.phonegap.com 
  </p>
  <p>
        and click on the button ‘Sign In’. In the sign-in page, you will
        be able to create a new Adobe ID, or, to sign-in with either
        facebook or google.
  </p>
  <p>
        Sign in to your phonegap build account, then click on the
        button ‘+ new app’ to create a new app.
        Then go to your github project Test, and click on the green
        button: ‘Clone or Download’. Then click on the copy to
        clipboard icon as shown in Fig 8-1 below.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
        After you have copied the link to your github project, go back
        to phonegap build website and paste the link into the the
        textbox where it says ‘paste .git repo’. See Fig 8-2 below to
        get an idea of how to do this.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/8-2.png" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 8-2 Pasting the github repo link into phonegap build</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        After you have pasted the github repo link, click on the
        button ‘Pull from .git repository’ as indicated by the 2nd red
        arrow as shown in Fig 8-2 above.
        Phonegap will fetch the project from the github repository.
        Next, you will need to refresh the page. Then, you will see the
        button: ‘Ready to build’ as shown in Fig 8-3 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/8-3.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 8-3 Ready to build</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        Just go ahead and click on the button ‘Ready to build’. It will
        take about a minute or two to build the apk. Once it has
        successfully completed building the apk, you will be able to
        see the screen change to that which is as shown in Fig 8-4
        below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/8-4.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 8-4 Successful completion of apk built process</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        From Fig 8-4 above, you will see that there is a new button in
        sea-green color with the label apk as indicated by the red
        arrow. Just click on it to download the apk file to your
        computer.
        That concludes this chapter. In the next chapter, we will
        learn how to install an Android emulator called nox player
        and install the apk on the Android emulator to test it.
