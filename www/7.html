      In this chapter, we will learn how to create a github account,
      install git-scm and also how to create repositories and
      upload our project to github. 
  </p>
  <h3>WHY UPLOAD TO GITHUB?</h3>
  <p>
      The reason is because, build.phonegap.com will only allow
      you to upload 1 zipped project directly. If you wanted to
      upload more, you will have to do it indirectly via github.
  </p>
  <h3>HOW TO SIGNUP FOR A GITHUB ACCOUNT?</h3>
  <p>
      Go to github.com and signup for a free account. The github
      page is shown in Fig 7-1 below.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
      Next, we need to download a github client that we will need
      to use to upload the files to github. It is called git-scm. Git-scm is a command line interface (CLI) tool used to communicate with github for purposes of uploading or
      downloading files. So head over to git-scm.com
      and download and install it. The git-scm website is as shown
      in Fig 7-2 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/7-2.png" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 7-2 git-scm.com</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      After downloading git-scm and installing it and after signing
      up for a github.com account, we are now ready to go to the
      next step, which is to create a new repository in github and
      using git-scm aka git, to upload our project to the repository.
  </p>
  <h3>UPLOADING PROJECT TO GITHUB</h3>
  <p>
      In this section, we will create a new repository on github and
      then upload our project.
  </p>
  <p>
      To create a new repository in github, click on the green
      button ‘New’. You will then see a textbox labelled ‘Repository
      name’ as shown in Fig 7-3 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/7-3.png" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 7-3 Creating a new repository in github</div>

  </p>
  <p>
      Give it a name ‘Test’. The default setting is Public. You can’t
      set Private unless you are a paying account. We want to use
      github for free, so we need to keep our project Public. After
      entering the name for our new repository, click on the green
      button ‘Create repository’.
      Github will then create a new repository and also show some
      instructions on how to upload your new file. This is shown in
      Fig 7-4 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/7-4.png" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 7-4 Github instructions after creating a new repo</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      The most important line is as indicated by the red arrow in
      Fig 7-4 above. Copy it.
      Then, open a cmd command terminal and navigate to your
      Test project folder:
  </p>
  <p>
      C:\Users\yourpc\Desktop\Test
  </p>
  <p>
      The location is different for your machine. So just follow the folder
      location on your machine.
      Then, execute these series of commands:
  </p>
  <p>
      git init
  </p>
  <p>
      git add .
  </p>
  <p>
      git commit -m “first commit”
  </p>
  <p>
      The next command is the one you copied from github.com:
  </p>
  <p>
      git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/Test.git
  </p>
  <p>
      Then finally type the command below to upload the project:
  </p>
  <p>
      git push -u origin master
  </p>
  <p>
      Note that after typing in git init, the next command is git add
      dot. There is a space between add and the dot. So it is like
      this: 
  </p>
  <p>
      git add .
  </p>
  <p>
      Once you have successfully uploaded the project files, go
      ahead and refresh your github page and you will see the new
      page with the files all uploaded as shown in Fig 7-5 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/7-5.png" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 7-5 All uploaded</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      In future, if you wanted to download this project on another
      different machine, just click on the green button ‘Clone or
      download’ as shown in Fig 7-5 above, and click on the icon
      copy button as shown by the second red arrow in Fig 7-5.
      Then open a terminal and type:
  </p>
  <p>
      git clone [ paste the line you copied above here ]
  </p>
  <p>
      It will download an exact copy to your new machine. Then,
      after making any new changes, if you wish to upload the
      changes, just execute these series of commands:
  </p>
  <p>
      git add .
  </p>
  <p>
      git commit -m “update”
  </p>
  <p>
      git push
  </p>
  <p>
      You can also use the same three commands above if you are
      making changes to the original copy on your original
      machine where you first created the project. Then, when you
      go to your second machine, you will need to pull down any
      updates. You can do this with this command:
  </p>
  <p>
      git pull
  </p>
  <p>
      That is all. We will also be using the copied github link to
      paste into build.phonegap.com when building our apk file in
      the next chapter.
      This concludes this chapter. In the next chapter, we will be
      using build.phonegap.com to create our apk file.
