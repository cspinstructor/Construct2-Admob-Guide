        In this chapter, we will insert our new Cordova AdmobFree
        object into our project, and also add a Function object. Then,
        we will create a new event sheet called Admob for purposes
        of creating 3 functions that will load and show our Admob
        ads.
  </p>
  <p>
        In Chapter 2, we added a touch event to the Event sheet 1. In
        this chapter we will add the Cordova AdmobFree object to
        our Construct 2 game and also create the new Admob event
        sheet.
  </p>
  <p>
        Insert a new object. In the ‘Insert New Object’ dialog that
        appears, scroll down and look for the new object called
        ‘CordovaAdmobFree’ under the section Plugins by
        Josek5494. See Fig 4-1 below. The red arrow shows the
        location of the object. It has a green dollar sign.

  </p>
  <p>
        After you have inserted the CordovaAdmobFree object to
        your project, you should be able to see it in the Project panel
        on the right, as indicated by the red arrow in Fig 4-2 below.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
        Next, we are going to create a new Event Sheet called Admob
        and create 3 functions within the Admob event sheet.
        First, add a Function object to your project as shown in Fig 4-
        3 below. The Function object would allow us to create
        functions.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-3.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-3. Adding a Function object</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        Then, create a new event sheet called ‘Admob’. To add a new
        event sheet, right-click on the Event Sheet Folder in the
        Project panel as shown in Fig 4-4 below. Then select ‘Add
        event sheet’.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-4.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-4. Adding a new event sheet called Admob</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        After adding the new event sheet called Admob, your screen
        should look something like Fig 4-5 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-5.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-5. New Admob event sheet added</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        We are now ready to add our 3 functions to our new Admob
        event sheet. Go ahead and click on the button ‘Add event’ in
        the Admob event sheet. See 4-6 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-6.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-6. Adding new event to Admob event sheet</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        After clicking on the ‘Add event’ button, the ‘Add event’
        window will open. Select the Function object as shown in Fig
        4-7 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-7.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-7. Add Function</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        In the next window that opens, select the ‘On Function’ event
        as shown in Fig 4-8 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-8.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-8. Selecting the ‘On Function’ event</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        You will then be asked to give a name for your function. Call
        it ‘loadAdmobAds’ as shown in Fig 4-9 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-9.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-9. Naming the function ‘loadAdmobAds’</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        After creating the new function, your Admob event sheet
        should look like Fig 4-10 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-10.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-10. Function ‘loadAdmobAds’ added</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        We will now add the actions to the function. The first action
        is to load a banner ad.
        To add an action, click on the button ‘Add action’ as shown in
        Fig 4-11 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-11.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-11. Add action for the function</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        Then, select the object CordovaAdmobFree as shown in Fig
        4-12 below. The object is the one with the green dollar icon
        as indicated by the red arrow.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-12.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-12. Selecting the CordovaAdmobFree object</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        Then, in the next screen, select ‘Load a banner’ action as
        indicated by the red arrow in Fig 4-13 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-13.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-13. Load a banner action selected</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        Then, in the next screen as shown in Fig 4-14 below, you can
        see the windows called ‘Parameters for CordovaAdmobFree’
        with some default settings. The default settings is to show
        the banner with the position: TOP CENTER and to overlap
        the contents. You may change the position if you like. But I
        will just leave at the default position.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-14.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-14. Setting banner position</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        At this point your Admob event sheet should look something
        like Fig 4-15 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-15.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-15. Function with one action ‘Load a banner ad’</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        We are now going to add another action called ‘Load an
        interstitial’.
        Repeat what you have done above as shown in Fig 4-11 and
        Fig 4-12, but when it comes to choosing the action, select
        ‘Load an interstitial’ as shown in Fig 4-16 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-16.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-16. Load an interstitial</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        In the next window as shown in Fig 4-17, you will note that
        the default setting for Overlap is True. No need to change it.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-17.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 4-17. Default parameter for interstitial ad</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        At this stage, you should have two actions added to the
        function ‘loadAdmobAds’ as shown in Fig 4-18 below.
  </p>
  <p>
      <img src="images/4-18.JPG" alt="">
      <div class="fig">Fig 18. Two actions added to function ‘loadAdmobAds’</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        This concludes this chapter. In the next chapter, we will add
        2 more functions to the Admob event sheet.
