    In this chapter, we will learn how to download and install an Android
    emulator called Nox Player, and how to transfer and install our apk files on
    it. Note that there are other alternatives to using an Android emulator. For
    example, you could use bluetooth or USB to transfer apk files to your
    physical Android phone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nox player is an Android virtual machine. It behaves exactly like a physical
    android device. Therefore, if your app can be installed and run on Nox
    player, this means that it will also be able to be installed on and run on
    your real physical android phone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Head over to my.bignox.com and click on the pink button which says
    ‘Muat Turun’ as shown in Fig 9-1 below. The words ‘Muat Turun’ is Malay
    language which means ‘Download’. Don’t worry, although the website is in
    Malay, the Nox player itself is entirely in English.

        After downloading the setup file, just click to install Nox

        Note that the default orientation is landscape. To rotate it to
        portrait orientation, just click on the change orientation icon
        on the right panel as indicated by the red arrow as shown in
        Fig 9-2 above.

  <h3>HOW TO INSTALL APK ON NOX PLAYER</h3>
  <p>
        To install the apk file onto Nox player, just drag the apk file
        and drop it on the desktop of the Nox player. That is all! This
        will cause Nox player to install the apk file. It will only take a
        few seconds. Upon successful completion of the installation,
        you will be able to see your new Test app’s icon on the
        desktop of Nox player as indicated by the red arrow as
        shown in Fig 9-3 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/9-3.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 9-3 Test app successfully installed</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        As can be seen from Fig 9-3 above, the Test app icon is on the
        desktop of Nox player. To run it, just click on the Test app
        icon.
        After clicking on the Test app icon, your app will open and
        you will be able to see something like what is shown in Fig 9-4 below.  
  </p>
  <p>

      <div class="fig">Fig 9-4 Test app successful launch</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        As shown in Fg 9-4, your app has 2 buttons. Just click on the
        button ‘Show Banner Ad’ and it will show a banner ad on top. Now go ahead and click on the Show Interstitial Ad button
        and you should see Fig 9-5 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/9-5.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 9-5. Showing interstitial ad</div>
  </p>
  <p>
    As these are test ads, you are welcomed to click on them. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Congratulations! You have successfully built, installed and
        tested your app on a real Android device. 
  </p>
  <p>
        Alternatively, you could also transfer the apk file to your
        physical Android phone using bluetooth. But you must first
        enable your phone to allow third-party apks to be installed.
  </p>
  <p>
        A word of caution. On some machines, sometimes Nox Player
        will not be able to run certain apps correctly, eg, failing to
        show pop-up windows etc. In such a case, you should use
        other alternatives to test your apk files, eg, using bluetooth
        or USB to transfer the apk files to your physical Android
        phone. 
  </p>
  <h3>LIVE ADS</h3>
  <p>
        If you wanted live ads, then just substitute the ad ids with
        your ids from Admob and also substitute the app-id in
        config.xml with your rea app-id from admob. Then, in the
        construct 2 CordovaAdmobFree properties, set Test mode to
        false.  
  </p>
  <h3>HOW TO REBUILD AN APK</h3>
  <p>
        First, we need to re-upload the edited project to github. To
        do this, open a cmd terminal and navigate to your Test
        project folder. Then type this command:
  </p>
  <p>
    git add .  
  </p>
  <p>
        Note that the last symbol is a dot. And it means all. Also take
        note that there is a space between add and the dot.
        Next, type in this command:
  </p>
  <p>
        git commit -m “update”
  </p>
  <p>
        The m means message. In this case the message for this
        version update is ‘update’. Feel free to use other messages.
        Next, type in this command:
  </p>
  <p>
        git push  
  </p>
  <p>
        The changes to your Test project will be pushed to github.
        After uploading your new version to github, head over to
        build.phonegap.com and click on the button ‘Update code’ as
        shown by the red arrow in Fig 9-6 below. 
  </p>
  <p>

    <div class="fig">Fig 9-6 Updating code on build.phonegap.com</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        After clicking on the above-said button, a pop-up will open to
        confirm your action. This can be seen in Fig 9-7 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/9-7.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 9-7 Pop-up to confirm pulling latest code from github</div>
  </p>
  <p>
        As can be seen in Fig 9-7 above, there is a sea-green button
        called ‘Pull latest’. Just click on it to update the Test project
        code from github and to rebuild the apk file.
        After built has completed, download the apk file and transfer
        to Nox Player and run the app.
  </p>
  <p>
        Congratulations! You now know how to implement AdMob
        ads. If you wish to deploy it to Google play, we will need to
        sign the apk with our keystore. We will be doing this in the
        next chapter.
