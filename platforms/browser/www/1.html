    In this chapter we will create a simple Construct 2 game for testing AdMob
    ads. Our game consists of only two buttons, with the labels ‘Show Banner Ad’
    and ‘Show Interstitial Ad’. Click on File/New then select the template ‘New
    empty SD portrait 16:9 project as shown in Fig 1-1 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/1-1.JPG" alt="" />
    <div class="fig">Fig 1-1 Selecting 16:9 portrait layout</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      You will note that this project’s window size has width: 480
      pixels and height: 854 pixels. Take a look at Fig 1-2 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/1-2.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 1-2 Window size</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      However, the layout at the moment has a width of 960 pixels
      and a height of 1708 pixels. See Fig 1-3 below.
  </p>

    <div class="fig">Fig 1-3 Layout width and height</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      It appears that the layout is much bigger than the window
      size. For our simple game, we need the layout to be the same
      size as the windows size. So go ahead and change the layout
      width to 480 pixels and the height to 854 pixels.
      Your layout should now look like what is shown in Fig 1-4
      below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/1-4.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 1-4 Layout matches windows size</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      Layout now matches the windows size. Windows size is what
      you actually see on the screen of your mobile device.
      Then insert a new sprite as shown in Fig 1-5 below. Call the
      sprite ‘btnShowBannerAd’
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/1-5.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 1-5. Adding a button for banner ad</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      Set the size and color based on Fig 1-6 below. The size is 200
      x 80 pixels. Use any color you like. In this example, I am
      using a light brownish color.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/1-6.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 1-6. Setting color and dimensions for banner ad button</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      Fig 1-7 below shows what the layout looks like at this stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/1-7.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 1-7. Layout with the first button</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      As shown in Fig 1-7 above, I placed the button somewhere in
      the top-half of the layout. Next, we will put a label on the button. Go ahead and insert a Text object as shown in Fig 1-8 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/1-8.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 1-8. Button’s label</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      Set the Name when inserted, to ‘txtButtonBannerAd’. Adjust
      the position and place it right on top of the button which we
      added earlier. Right now, your layout should look something like Fig 1-9
      below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/1-9.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 1-9. Placing the label on top of the button</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      Note that I have also set the display text to ‘Show Banner Ad’
      and also increased the font size to 17. Next, we will create
      another button with the label ‘Show Interstitial Ad’.
      A simple way to do this is to clone the existing button. So, go
      ahead and right-click on the button and select ‘Clone object
      type’ as shown in Fig 1-10 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/1-10.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 1-10. Cloning a button</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      After cloning the button, place it somewhere at the bottom-
      half of the screen as shown in Fig 1-11 below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/1-11.JPG" alt="">
    <div class="fig">Fig 1-11. Cloned button and text</div>
  </p>
  <p>
      As shown in Fig 1-11 above, after cloning the button, I have
      renamed it to ‘btnShowInterstitialAd’. Please also clone the
      Text object and change its display text to ‘Show Interstitial
      Ad’. At this point, your layout should look Fig 1-11 above.
      This concludes this chapter. In the next chapter, we will add
      event handlers for the buttons.
